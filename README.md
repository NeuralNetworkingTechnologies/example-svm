# Example of creating and using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Machine Learning in Ruby
This example will show how to implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF (Gaussian) kernel in Ruby using rb-libsvm for classification.

For more information about this network see the blog post [Implementing Classification using a SVM in Ruby](http://www.practicalai.io/implementing-classification-using-a-svm-in-ruby/).
